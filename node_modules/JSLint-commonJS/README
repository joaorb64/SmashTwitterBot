fulljslint.js contains the fully commented JSLINT function.

fulljslint.html runs the JSLINT function in a web page. The page also depends
on adsafe.js and json2.js (which are not included in this project) and
intercept.js (which is).

intercept.js scripts the fulljslint.html ui by augmenting ADsafe.

rhino.js is a sample companion script to run fulljslint.js on Rhino.

wsh.js is a sample companion script to run fulljslint.js on WSH.

lint.html describes JSLint's usage.
